Additionally, I implemented Docker for local development, optimized the deployment process to reduce the deployment time for over 1,000 instances to under 15 minutes, and integrated GitLab CI/CD. My contributions also included laying the foundation for a PHPUnit test suite, integrating Cypress E2E testing into the pipeline with QA, and ensuring efficient collaboration across the team.",
